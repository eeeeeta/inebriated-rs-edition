*everybody's favourite drunkard!*

wat?
---

The inebriated project line is a series of implementations of the same thing: a drunk AI that takes
input sentences and uses them to form stuff that sort-of makes sense and is sometimes funny.


This is the Rust implementation. Currently, it's *very very alpha* and not ready for doing anything yet.
